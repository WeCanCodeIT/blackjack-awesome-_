**Playing Blackjack AWSM:**

When the game first starts, place an inital bet amount.  The game defaults to start the player with 200 chips.  The first two cards will show and the player can choose to "Hit", "Stand", or "Double".  Normal Black Jack rules apply.  The player can play additonal rounds until they are out of chips or until the initial deck is out of cards.

Game logic is using this library: ```https://www.npmjs.com/package/blackjack-dealer-logic```
